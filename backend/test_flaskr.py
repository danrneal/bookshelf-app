# @TODO: Write at least two tests for each endpoint - one each for success and
#           error behavior.
#        You can feel free to write additional tests for nuanced functionality,
#        Such as adding a book without a rating, etc.
#        Since there are four routes currently, you should have at least eight
#           tests.
# Optional: Update the book information in setUp to make the test database
#           your own!
