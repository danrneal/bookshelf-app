# Bookshelf App

This app allows users to display books as part of their library. Users can add new books to thier library with title, author and rating; update their rating of existing entries; or delete existing entries. This app uses python3, nodejs, and a postgresql database.

## Set-up

Set-up a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see (venv) before your command prompt now. (You can type `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment any time.)

### Backend

Navigate to the backend folder

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your environment variables:

```bash
touch .env
echo FLASK_APP=flaskr >> .env
echo FLASK_ENV=development >> .env
```

### Frontend

Navigate to the frontend folder

Install the requirements:

```bash
npm install
```
